## Design
### Colour Palette

![Colours used](https://i.imgur.com/TiEA4OC.png)

"White" is also used to make the different sections stand out and "Coral" as a point-of-interest colour.

To reflect the outdoors and nature aspect of the websites mission i choose a natural, light and muted colour scheme. The palette is picked from the hero-bg image.

### Typography

- **Cantarell** is the font used for the body (with sans serif as fallback) because it is easy to read and the name reminds me of nature
- **Fjalla One** is the font used for the headings and logo (with sans serif as fallback) because it is bold and adventurous, matching the theme of the site.

### Imagery

Few but impactful images helps the user experience by being clear on the subject matter of the site.

- The hero image speakt loudly to the adventure and nature aspects.
- The member portraits show the feeling of happiness being a part of the club can result in.

### Overall Feel

I wanted to elicit a feeling of excitement for getting outdoors and make a simple and clear experience that feels light and airy.

### Wireframes

First draft was just super quick pen on striped notebook showing desktop and phone view:

Then i used vscode to mock up the sections in both desktop and responsive view at different sizes.
