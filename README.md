## Design
### Colour Palette

![Colours used](https://i.imgur.com/TiEA4OC.png)

To reflect the outdoors and nature aspect of the websites mission i choose a natural, light and muted colour scheme. The palette is picked from the hero-bg image.

### Typography

- **Cantarell** is the font used for the body (with sans serif as fallback) because it is easy to read and the name reminds me of nature
- **Fjalla One** is the font used for the headings and logo (with sans serif as fallback) because it is bold and adventurous, matching the theme of the site.

### Imagery
Few but impactful images helps the user experience by being clear on the subject matter of the site.
- The hero image speakt loudly to the adventure and nature aspects.
- The member portraits show the feeling of happiness being a part of the club can result in.
